# Vacation Package Recommendation App

This application was originally developed for MET CS664 as an exploration of the ChatGPT API. It basically functions as a single-purpose chatbot application for a fictional travel agency:
   1. It prompts the user to briefly describe their ideal vacation.
   2. It then generates a brief "sales pitch" to recommend a vacation package from those offered by the agency, suitable to the user's desires.

The skeleton of the application is based on a simple introductory Python Flask app (Pet Name Generator) offered as a quickstart tutorial by OpenAI. See original documentation below.


# OpenAI API Quickstart - Python example app

This is an example pet name generator app used in the OpenAI API [quickstart tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart). It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web framework. Check out the tutorial or follow the instructions below to get set up.

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository.

3. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-quickstart-python
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment:

   ```bash
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the requirements:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Make a copy of the example environment variables file:

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

7. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file.

8. Run the app:

   ```bash
   $ flask run
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)! For the full context behind this example app, check out the [tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart).
